WHY, AND HOW IT WORKS

 It was developed in HTML5, with CSS and, mainly Jquery, with much love for card games. Why? Because my grandma loved to play cards with little me. Fond memories made me enjoy this project.

 It calls asynchronously the deck from a separate file by the way of AJAX, and uses local storage to hold the information of your current funds.
 Feature: Right below everything (scroll down fearlessly) you will find hidden a list of distinguished players, from which the bots take their names asynchronously (it is actually from an API).

BLACKJACK

The game keeps track locally of the player funds. Rules to win are try to reach as close as possible to 21 points without busting farther than that. 
A money sum is bet, which is duplicated in case of a win, and added to the total player funds. 
The player is dealt two cards, via an animation, and every time he/she clicks "hit" receives an additional card (and points). Once the player clicks "stand"
the computer begins to play, procuring the same that the player did in order to win against him, under a series of adaptive conditions depending on the status
of the player´s laid hand.

Information is displayed accordingly to each situation to give advice to the player and letting him/her know the results.

What´s missing? well, I would like to make it portable-friendly for cellphones. Certainly I would like to add better animations. I also have in account to 
change the button display to something more fancy in the bottom of the screen. I will certainly return to this wonderful project once I have mastered ReactJS.

Hope you enjoy it, and please, any counsel or critic is widely welcome. Hope to hear from you!

Best regards, 

Lucas
